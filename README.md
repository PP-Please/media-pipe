# Media-Pipe
A UNSW research project that uses OpenCV and a body detection model to determine ...

## Prerequisites
* OpenCV 4.x, with extra modules. You need to build OpenCV to include these extra modules. You can find the method [here.](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)
    <details>
    <summary>Installation Steps</summary>

    1. Download OpenCV and the extra modules.
        ```
            git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
            git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
        ```
    2. Make the build directory, and configure OpenCV. Note:
    * The `-D CUDA_ARCH_BIN` tag; you need to set this value according to your GPU's architecture, which you can find [here.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) For example, a RTX 3000 series GPU has value 8.6.
    * The `-DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH` tag; this should be set to the path where you cloned `opencv_contrib`. Represent this path as `[path]`.
        ```
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
            -DWITH_CUDA=ON \
            -DWITH_CUDNN=OFF \
            -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=8.6 \
            -DWITH_TBB=ON \
            -DWITH_V4L=ON \
            -DWITH_QT=ON \
            -DWITH_OPENGL=ON \
            -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
            -DOPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON \
            -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=[path]/modules \
            ..
        ```
    3. Compile OpenCV with the terminal commands `make -j$(nproc)` and then `sudo make install`.

* CMake

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
For Ubuntu or WSL:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:emmettmitsuki/media-pipe.git
    cd media-pipe
    ```

2. Create a build directory, and run cmake.
    ```
    cd {media-pipe_folder}
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Install the `.caffemodel` required for this program. The .zip can be installed from [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCSxJZpnWvM00hx49CJ2zky7PWGzpcEh/edit) Find the `pose_iter_160000.caffemodel` file in the path `pose/mpi`, and drag it to the corresponding path inside the `media-pipe` folder `models/pose/mpi/pose_iter_160000.caffemodel`.

4. Run `make` to build the program.


You can run the program using the terminal command `./OpenCVWebcamApp`.

## Troubleshooting
* `can't open camera by index`: This suggests that the webcam is not accessible by the program, either because the webcam is not connected or there are insufficient permissions. Run `ls -al /dev/video*`.
    * If the permissions of `/dev/video0` is `crw-------`, the webcam has insufficient permissions and the command `sudo chmod 666 /dev/video0` should be run to temporarily modify the permissions.
    * If the command returns `No such file or directory`, the webcam may not be connected. If on WSL, you may need to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_YnACEPmrM) video guide to enable webcam drivers.
